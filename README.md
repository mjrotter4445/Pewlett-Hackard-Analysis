# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
##Project Overview 

###Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to prepare Pewlett-Hackard, a large company, for the upcoming “silver Tsunami”.   A large number of employees are expected to begin retiring at a fast rate.  Pewlett-Hackard wants to be prepared with retirement packages, open positions, and training opportunities for replacement employees.    The types of information the HR Department needs is: 
1.	Identify the retiring employees by their title
2.	Determine the sum of retiring employees grouped by title
3.	Identify the employees eligible for participation in the mentorship program
4.	Determine the number of roles-to-fill grouped by title and department
5.	Determine the number of qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor 
the next generation grouped by title and department.   


###Background:  
In this project, we use **QuickDBD** and Schemas to design databases and writing intermediate-level SQL queries to answer important business questions for the company’s HR department. We also utilized *PstreSQL* a data base system to load, build, and host company data and **pgAdmin** The result is a well-designed database with reporting capabilities.   

###Data Files – 
-	6 csv files containing employee details and job position information 

###**ERD and Schema** 
The entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a tool we use to design the database table relationships. The drawing is called a schema and it is a blueprint for the conceptual design of the database.
